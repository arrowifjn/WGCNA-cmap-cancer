## The structure of this research
### The purpose of this research
The purpose of this research is to find some potential prognostic genes and some candidate small molecule for HCC treatment.
### The process of this reaserch
this is a two step research, the first step is try to find out the potential prognostic genes in HCC, and then try to find some cure targeting those genes. 

1. data searching, the public data base are GEO and TCGA.
2. data preparation, to get some expression matrix, and the phenotype tables. 
3. data analysing , limma and WGCNA
4. data validation, data from GEPIA database

### Data source: 
we need gene expression data from tumor and non-tumor, to find out what is feature gene expression in the tumor. To do this, we need to search and download those data from GEO or TCGA. According to the reference, we are trying to do some data mining from 
GSE14520, GSE25097, GSE29721, and GSE62232,and TCGA
